I possess extensive experience in applied social sciences, functioning both as a scholar and a senior consultant. My expertise in advanced quantitative methodologies, coupled with my experience in managing diverse teams, has been instrumental in driving significant developments in socio-political research and policy formulation. I hold a PhD in Public Policy from the University of Chicago, and my undergraduate education encompasses both economics and sociology.
